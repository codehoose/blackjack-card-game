# Blackjack Card Game
## Introduction
The videos that started it all! :)

I recorded a series of videos on how to build a card game. The original videos are located [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH8FoddkVY&list=PLZo2FfoMkJeE6GXx8cEUeR9KzItTvaKlz).

I moved the original source from the old Bitbucket repository to this new GitHub repo. My intent is to bring the game up to date by revisiting it, and to add a networking component to it to allow for more than one player to play against the dealer.

The project has been updated to Unity 2017.3.1.f1

## How This Repository Is Structured
The 'master' branch will contain the bleeding edge source code for the game. Each video's code will be placed in its own branch. If you want to play along with the videos, you should get the 'starter' branch. Every other video will be called 'video#-some-description' where # is the number of the video.
